# Linear and Polynomial Regression

Comparison of linear vs polynomial regression on synthetic data using manual and sklearn methods.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Models: OLS, Gradient Descent, Polynomial Regression (degree 1 to 7)
- Tools: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Analysis: Underfitting vs Overfitting

## ðŸ§ª Result
- Polynomial degree 3 gave best trade-off for nonlinear dataset.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Run the notebook to view model fits, error plots, and result analysis.
