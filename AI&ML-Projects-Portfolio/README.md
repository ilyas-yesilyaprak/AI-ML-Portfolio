Personal AI/ML Projects â€” Gender Classification, Digit Recognition, and Regression Models

# Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

Classifies handwritten digits using k-NN and Decision Tree classifiers.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Dataset: MNIST
- Models: k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees
- Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC curves

## ðŸ§ª Result
- k = 3 gave best performance while avoiding overfitting
- Decision Tree best at depth = 10

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

# Gender Classification using Transfer Learning with VGG-16

This project performs binary gender classification using the CelebA dataset and transfer learning with a pretrained VGG-16 model.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Dataset: CelebA30k (30,000+ images)
- Model: VGG-16 pretrained on ImageNet
- Techniques: Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuning, Stratified Sampling
- Tools: Python, PyTorch, Google Colab, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score

## ðŸ§ª Results
- Best test accuracy: **96.2%**
- Experimented with 4 configurations of learning rates and fine-tuning

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or run locally after installing PyTorch.

# Linear and Polynomial Regression

Comparison of linear vs polynomial regression on synthetic data using manual and sklearn methods.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Models: OLS, Gradient Descent, Polynomial Regression (degree 1 to 7)
- Tools: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Analysis: Underfitting vs Overfitting

## ðŸ§ª Result
- Polynomial degree 3 gave best trade-off for nonlinear dataset.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Run the notebook to view model fits, error plots, and result analysis.
