# Gender Classification using Transfer Learning with VGG-16

This project performs binary gender classification using the CelebA dataset and transfer learning with a pretrained VGG-16 model.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Dataset: CelebA30k (30,000+ images)
- Model: VGG-16 pretrained on ImageNet
- Techniques: Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuning, Stratified Sampling
- Tools: Python, PyTorch, Google Colab, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score

## ðŸ§ª Results
- Best test accuracy: **96.2%**
- Experimented with 4 configurations of learning rates and fine-tuning

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or run locally after installing PyTorch.
